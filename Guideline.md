## Guideline for our teammates

### Communicate:

Good communication is key to working effectively with others on a project. Make sure you establish clear communication channels with your friends, such as using chat apps or video conferencing tools. Discuss the project goals, timelines, and responsibilities with your friends to ensure everyone is on the same page.

### Follow a workflow:

It is important to establish a clear workflow for your project. You can use a popular workflow such as Gitflow, or create your own. The workflow should include guidelines for branching, committing, and merging code changes. It's important to make sure everyone on the team follows the workflow to avoid confusion and conflicts.

### Use meaningful commit messages:

When committing changes to the repository, it's important to use clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the changes being made. This makes it easier for others to understand the code changes and helps to maintain a clean commit history.

### Review each other's code:

Code review is an important part of the development process. Encourage your friends to review each other's code and provide constructive feedback. This can help to catch bugs and improve the overall quality of the code.

### Test your code:

It's important to test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. You can use automated tests or manual testing to validate your code. Encourage your friends to test their code as well to catch any bugs or issues.

### Respect each other's contributions:

Everyone on the team should respect each other's contributions to the project. Avoid making changes without discussing them with your friends first. If you have a disagreement about a code change, try to resolve it through respectful discussion.

## Collaboration Guidelines for Project Members: Using Semantic Versioning and Member Codes

### Use a member code when you commit something:

Each member should have a unique two-letter code that they can use when committing their changes to the project. The #### codes are as follows:

- Bhanuka: bh
- Atheek: an
- Afeef: af
- Oshada: op
- Nanthu: ny
- Savi: ss
  When making a commit, start your commit message with your member code followed by a brief description of the changes you made.
  For example, if Bhanuka made a minor update to the Mouse Effect, his commit message could be:
  mouse effect bh 0.2.1
