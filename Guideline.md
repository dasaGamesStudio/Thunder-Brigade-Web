## Collaboration Guidelines for Project Members: Using Semantic Versioning and Member Codes

### Use a member code when you commit something:

Each member should have a unique two-letter code that they can use when committing their changes to the project. The #### codes are as follows:

  - Bhanuka: bh
  - Atheek: an
  - Afeef: af
  - Oshada: op
  - Nanthu: ny
  - Savi: ss
  When making a commit, start your commit message with your member code followed by a brief description of the changes you made.
  For example, if Bhanuka made a minor update to the Mouse Effect, his commit message could be:
  mouse effect bh 0.2.1
  
### Use semantic versioning:

When versioning your project, use the semantic versioning system with three numbers separated by dots. The numbers represent the following:
  - The first number is the major version number, and it should be incremented when you make significant changes to the project.
  - The second number is the minor version number, and it should be incremented when you make smaller changes or add new features.
  - The third number is the patch number, and it should be incremented when you make minor fixes or adjustments.

For example, if you made a minor update to the README file, your commit message could be:
readme bh 1.1.5
If Atheek later makes a minor update to the README file, their commit message could be:
readme an 1.2.0

### Keep your commit messages simple: 

When writing your commit messages, keep them simple and concise. Use clear and descriptive language to explain what you changed, and avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be confusing to others.

### Be consistent: 

Make sure everyone in your group is following the same guidelines for committing their changes. This will help keep your project organized and make it easier for everyone to understand what changes have been made.
